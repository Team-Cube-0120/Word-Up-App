## Naming Conventions

- Team mates are expected to follow these git conventions thorughout the project to have a standard structure for the commits (section will be deleted before final deliverable)

    #### Branch Names
    - Branch Names need to follow the format: `<Sprint Number>/<Epic Name>/..>`
    - For example: `SprintOne/CommunityEvents`

    #### Commit Messages
    - Commit Messages need to follow the format `[<Sprint Number> - <Epic Name>] : commit message`
    - For example: `[Sprint One - Community Events]: updated Events creation form`
